2D Racing game - School project

In this project I have created a 2D top view racing game. 
This game is currently for a minimal of 2 players.
In this game the players can select a car and track to race on.
During the race the players can use various powerups to help them win.

In this project I have tried to write the code so that is easy to expand on. 
For example it is now easy to add more tracks/cars in the game. 
I also tried to keep the code clean and readable for any other programmer that would read through my code.
